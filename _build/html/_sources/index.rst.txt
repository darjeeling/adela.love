Who am I?
---------

Happy to see you! 

My name is Adela Chung, living in Seoul, Korea. 

I started studying development in earnest last year. I also have a college degree in Computer Science. 

I am writing this blog in Korean and English both. English is not my first language, mine is Korean! The reason why I write in English and Korean both is in some contexts it is sometimes more convenient to express in a language other than the native language.

I love plants. There are many kinds of pretty plants at home such as Monstera and Tara. These days, I'm into the fun of growing salad vegetables myself.

Why create this blog?
---------------------

I felt limited in simply recording what I had learned. Instead of deploying the finished form of writing, I wanted to organize the documents by taking a little bit of what I learned. So I used the right sphinx_ for wiki.

What can I get here?
--------------------

You can look at the process of trying and completing something. I'll put together a reference that helped me.
